E-compass/accelerometer MEMS (ST MEMS LSM303DLHC)

The LSM303DLHC is an ultra-compact low-power system-in-package featuring a 3D digital 
linear acceleration sensor and a 3D digital magnetic sensor. It includes a sensing element 
and an IC interface able to provide the measured acceleration to the external world through 
I2C serial interface.
The LSM303DLHC has dynamically user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±8g and is capable of 
measuring acceleration, and a magnetic field full scale from ±1.3g to 8.1g with an output 
data rate of 100 Hz or 400 Hz.
The STM32F303VCT6 MCU controls this motion sensor through the I2C interface.

Gyroscope MEMS (ST MEMS L3GD20)

The L3GD20 is an ultra-compact, low-power, three-axis angular rate sensor. It includes a 
sensing element and an IC interface able to provide the measured angular rate to the 
external world through the I2C/SPI serial interface.
The L3GD20 has dynamically user-selectable full scales of ±250 dps/±500 dps/±2000 dps 
and is capable of measuring rates.
The STM32F303VCT6 MCU controls this motion sensor through the SPI interface.

PWM (servo) 
The typical RC servo expects to see a pulse every 20 ms, however this can vary within a wide range that differs from servo to servo. The width of the pulse will determine how far the motor turns. For example, in many RC servos a 1.5 ms pulse will make the motor turn to the 90° position (neutral position). The low time (and the total period) can vary over a wide range, and vary from one pulse to the next, without any effect on the position of the servo motor.
